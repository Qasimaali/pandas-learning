## 🧠 Topics Overview

### 1. Setup & Basics
- What is Pandas and why use it  
- Importing Pandas (`import pandas as pd`)  
- Reading and Writing data (`read_csv`, `to_excel`, etc.)

### 2. Data Structures
- Series creation and attributes  
- DataFrame creation, renaming columns, viewing data  

### 3. Data Selection & Indexing
- Selecting rows and columns  
- `loc[]`, `iloc[]`, conditional filtering  
- `set_index()` and `reset_index()`

### 4. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing data (`isnull`, `fillna`, `dropna`)  
- Removing duplicates  
- Changing data types (`astype`)  
- String operations (`str.replace`, `str.lower`)  

### 5. Data Exploration
- Summary statistics (`describe`, `mean`, `value_counts`)  
- Sorting, unique values, and counts  

### 6. Combining, Grouping & Advanced Concepts
- `concat`, `merge`, `join`  
- GroupBy, aggregation, pivot tables  
- MultiIndex, reshaping, melting, rolling, and lambda functions  

### 7. Integration & Projects
- Integration with NumPy and Matplotlib  
- Exporting final datasets  
- Hands-on mini projects: Netflix, COVID-19, Students’ Performance, IPL, E-commerce

## 🚀 Final Goal

By the end of this journey, I’ll be able to:
- Confidently analyze, clean, and visualize datasets using Pandas  
- Write efficient, readable, and organized Python code  
- Demonstrate consistent learning progress on GitHub  
- Apply Pandas skills to **real-world data analysis projects**
